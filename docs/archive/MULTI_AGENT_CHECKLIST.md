## Key Features Implemented

### Robustness
- [x] Handles abandoned work gracefully
- [x] Supports emergency interruptions
- [x] Provides clear recovery paths
- [x] Maintains system stability

### Communication
- [x] Multiple channels for coordination
- [x] Clear status tracking
- [x] Handoff procedures
- [x] Conflict resolution

### Onboarding
- [x] Self-guided initialization
- [x] State assessment tools

## Test Scenarios to Verify

1. **Fresh Start**: New human/agent with clean repo
2. **Active Agents**: New agent joining ongoing work
3. **Abandoned Work**: Previous agent stopped mid-task
4. **Emergency Recovery**: Uncommitted changes, no handoff
5. **Multiple Abandonment**: Several incomplete agents
6. **Conflict Resolution**: Two agents need same files

## Success Criteria

A new Claude Code agent should be able to:
- ✅ Understand the current state within 1 minute
- ✅ Make informed decisions about how to proceed
- ✅ Initialize correctly for their scenario
- ✅ Work without disrupting other agents
- ✅ Handle interruptions gracefully
- ✅ Leave clear traces for the next agent
