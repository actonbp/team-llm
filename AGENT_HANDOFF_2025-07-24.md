# Agent Handoff Document - July 24, 2025

## Session Summary

**Agent-950** (Backend Core Implementation) and **Agent-830** (Frontend & Integration Testing) worked in parallel to build the team-llm platform. This document captures the final state and provides clear guidance for the next agent.

## Work Completed

### Agent-950 Accomplishments:
- ✅ Implemented all database models with async SQLAlchemy
- ✅ Created complete REST APIs (Experiments, Sessions, Participants)
- ✅ Built WebSocket infrastructure for real-time communication
- ✅ Added mock AI agents for testing without API keys
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Fixed SQLAlchemy metadata conflicts

### Agent-830 Accomplishments:
- ✅ Built 70% of frontend (Experiment management, Session monitoring)
- ✅ Discovered and fixed 11 critical integration issues
- ✅ Implemented missing Participants API
- ✅ Fixed WebSocket connection issues
- ✅ Created AI agent test scripts
- ✅ Verified OpenAI API connectivity

## Critical Issues Fixed

1. **SQLite UUID Issue**: All IDs must be converted to strings
2. **API Path Issues**: All endpoints require trailing slashes
3. **WebSocket Format**: Messages need specific structure
4. **Enum Mismatches**: Fixed case sensitivity issues
5. **Schema/Model Sync**: Fixed nullable fields and field names

## Current State

### What Works:
```bash
# Create experiment ✓
POST /api/experiments/

# Create session ✓
POST /api/sessions/

# Create participants ✓
POST /api/participants/

# WebSocket connects ✓
ws://localhost:8000/ws/chat/{session_id}?participant_id={participant_id}
```

### What's Broken:
- AI agents don't have natural conversation
- Turn-taking logic not implemented
- Session completion detection missing

## Files to Keep

### Essential Backend Files:
- `backend/app/` - All API implementations
- `backend/app/agents/mock_agent.py` - For testing without API keys
- `backend/.env.example` - Shows required configuration

### Essential Test Files:
- `scripts/test-ai-agents.py` - Main integration test
- `scripts/restaurant_task_config.py` - Task configuration

### Files to DELETE:
- `scripts/simple_ws_test.py`
- `scripts/test_openai.py`
- `scripts/ai_conversation_manager.py`
- `scripts/test_natural_conversation.py`
- Any other experimental scripts

## Next Steps for New Agent

### Priority 1: Create Simple All-AI Simulation
```python
# backend/scripts/run_ai_simulation.py
"""
Simple script that:
1. Creates an experiment with restaurant task
2. Creates a session with 4 AI agents
3. Has them discuss and rank locations
4. Outputs a transcript
"""
```

### Priority 2: Implement Natural Conversation
- Use OpenAI API (key is in backend/.env)
- Each agent should:
  - Wait 1-3 seconds before responding
  - Reference what others said
  - Share knowledge gradually
  - Work toward consensus

### Priority 3: Generate Readable Transcript
```
[10:23:15] Alex: Hey team! Should we start with parking info?
[10:23:18] Jordan: Good idea! I know East Point has high foot traffic
[10:23:21] Casey: I can add that East Point costs $800K
[10:23:24] Morgan: Great teamwork! Let's check all locations
```

## Don't Waste Time On:
- Frontend improvements (70% is enough for now)
- Complex conversation managers
- More test scripts
- Deployment features
- Human participant features

## Key Technical Notes

### WebSocket Message Format:
```json
{
  "type": "chat",
  "content": "message text here"
}
```

### Agent Configuration:
```python
AGENT_CONFIGS = [
  {
    "name": "Alex",
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "persona": "Analytical, counts criteria",
    "knowledge": {
      "East Point": "Parking: 60 spaces, Competition: Low",
      "Starlight": "Parking: None, Size: >2000 sqft"
    }
  }
  # ... 3 more agents
]
```

### Restaurant Task:
- 3 locations: East Point Mall, Starlight Valley, Cape James Beach
- 10 criteria to evaluate
- Each agent knows different facts
- Goal: Reach consensus on ranking

## Success Criteria

The next agent succeeds when:
1. Four AI agents have a natural conversation
2. They share information gradually
3. They reach consensus on ranking
4. A readable transcript is generated

## Final Notes

The platform infrastructure is solid. All the hard debugging work is done. The next agent just needs to make the AI agents talk naturally using the restaurant task that's already configured.

Good luck!
