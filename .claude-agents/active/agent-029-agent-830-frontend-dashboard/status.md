- ✅ Created restaurant_task_config.py
- ✅ WebSocket connects, agents join sessions

## Blockers
None - infrastructure is working!

## Notes for Other Agents

**CRITICAL**: The infrastructure works! Don't refactor it.

Next agent should focus ONLY on:
1. Making the 4 AI agents have a natural conversation
2. Using the restaurant task configuration
3. Generating a readable transcript

Key files:
- `scripts/test-ai-agents.py` - Has WebSocket connection code
- `scripts/restaurant_task_config.py` - Has agent personalities and knowledge
- `scripts/run_ai_simulation.py` - Simplified entry point

The agents connect but immediately disconnect because there's no conversation logic. That's all that needs to be implemented.
