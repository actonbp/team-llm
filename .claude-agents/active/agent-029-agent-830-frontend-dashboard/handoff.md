# Handoff Notes: agent-830-frontend-dashboard ‚Üí Next Agent

**Handoff Date**: 2025-07-24 17:10
**From Agent**: agent-830 (Frontend Dashboard)
**Work Completed**: Fixed critical infrastructure, ready for AI conversation

## What Was Done
- ‚úÖ Built Frontend Components
  - Details: ExperimentList, ExperimentForm, SessionMonitor with WebSocket
  - Location: `frontend/src/components/`
- ‚úÖ Fixed 11+ Backend Integration Issues
  - Details: UUID conversions, enum mismatches, missing APIs, WebSocket bugs
  - Location: See log.md for full list of files
- ‚úÖ Implemented Missing Participants API
  - Details: Full CRUD operations for participants
  - Location: `backend/app/api/participants.py`, `backend/app/schemas/participant.py`
- ‚úÖ Created Test Infrastructure
  - Details: WebSocket connections work, agents join sessions
  - Location: `scripts/test-ai-agents.py`, `scripts/restaurant_task_config.py`

## What Remains
- üî≤ AI Agent Conversation Logic
  - Why not completed: Out of scope for frontend agent
  - Recommended approach: Use OpenAI API with agent personalities from config
- üî≤ Natural Turn-Taking
  - Blocker: Needs conversation manager implementation
  - Next steps: See Agent 950's guidance on turn-taking logic

## Important Decisions Made
1. **Decision**: Fixed backend instead of building more frontend
   - **Rationale**: Can't test frontend without working backend
   - **Alternatives considered**: Mock the backend (rejected - too many issues)

2. **Decision**: Kept test scripts simple
   - **Rationale**: Complex abstractions were failing
   - **Impact**: Easier to debug and understand

## Gotchas & Warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SQLite requires ALL UUIDs to be strings
  - Details: Database doesn't support UUID type
  - How to handle: Always use str(uuid) in queries
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WebSocket URL is `/ws/chat/{session_id}`
  - Details: NOT `/ws/session/{session_id}`
  - How to handle: Use correct URL format
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't refactor the backend
  - Details: It works now after many fixes
  - How to handle: Focus on conversation logic only

## Test Results
- ‚úÖ Backend APIs: All working
- ‚úÖ WebSocket connections: Successful
- ‚ùå AI conversation: Not implemented
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Full simulation: Blocked on conversation logic

## Useful Commands
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Run AI simulation test
python scripts/test-ai-agents.py

# Quick WebSocket test
python scripts/run_ai_simulation.py

# Check agent status
./scripts/agent-status.sh
```

## Recommended Next Agent Profile
- **Skills needed**: OpenAI API, async Python, conversation design
- **Estimated time**: 2-4 hours to implement conversation
- **Priority tasks**: Make agents talk naturally about restaurants

## Questions for Next Agent to Consider
1. Should agents wait for each other or respond immediately?
2. How to handle the "task-complete" trigger naturally?
3. Should we implement typing indicators?

## Branch Status
- Branch name: `feature/agent-830-frontend-dashboard`
- Last commit: Not committed yet
- PR status: Not created
- Conflicts: None expected

## The ONE Thing to Remember
**The infrastructure works!** Agents connect via WebSocket. They just need to talk. That's literally all that's missing.
