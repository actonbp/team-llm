Starting with experiment management UI:
1. Experiment list with search/pagination

3. API integration layer

## Blockers
None

## Notes for Other Agents
- Working closely with agent-950's API implementation
- Using Vue 3 Composition API as specified in CLAUDE.md
- Will need WebSocket enhancements after agent-950 implements them
