# Handoff Notes: agent-830-frontend-dashboard ‚Üí Next Agent

**Handoff Date**: 2025-07-24 16:30:00
**From Agent**: agent-830-frontend-dashboard
**Work Completed**: Frontend dashboard with experiments & sessions (70% complete)

## What Was Done
- ‚úÖ Multi-Agent Documentation Improvements
  - Details: Fixed critical identity confusion issue after agent-950 incident
  - Location: MULTI_AGENT_ONBOARDING.md, scripts/recover-identity.sh, CLAUDE.md
- ‚úÖ Experiment Management UI
  - Details: Full CRUD interface consuming backend APIs
  - Location: frontend/src/components/experiments/*.vue, composables/useExperiments.js
- ‚úÖ Session Monitoring Dashboard
  - Details: Real-time WebSocket monitoring with live chat viewer
  - Location: frontend/src/components/sessions/*.vue, composables/useSessions.js
- ‚úÖ AI Agent Test Script
  - Details: Test script for running AI simulations locally
  - Location: scripts/test-ai-agents.py

## What Remains
- üî≤ Participant Management Interface
  - Why not completed: Prioritized experiment & session features first
  - Recommended approach: Create ParticipantList.vue with consent indicators
- üî≤ Error Handling & Loading States
  - Blocker: Focused on core functionality first
  - Next steps: Add error boundaries and loading spinners to all components
- üî≤ UI Polish & Styling
  - Blocker: Function over form in initial implementation
  - Next steps: Match design system, add responsive layouts

## Important Decisions Made
1. **Decision**: Used Vue 3 Composition API exclusively
   - **Rationale**: Modern approach, better TypeScript support
   - **Alternatives considered**: Options API (rejected for consistency)

2. **Decision**: Made useWebSocket accept URL parameter
   - **Rationale**: Needed flexibility for different connection contexts
   - **Impact**: All WebSocket consumers must provide URL

## Gotchas & Warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend files were reset during session
  - Details: Some components reverted to skeleton state
  - How to handle: Check git status and restore from branch if needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WebSocket URL format critical
  - Details: Must use `/ws/session/{id}?participant_id=X`
  - How to handle: Always include participant_id parameter

## Test Results
- ‚úÖ Manual testing: Experiment CRUD working
- ‚úÖ Manual testing: Session monitoring with WebSocket working
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Automated tests: Not implemented yet

## Useful Commands
```bash
# Run the AI simulation test
cd scripts && python test-ai-agents.py

# Start frontend dev server
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Check multi-agent status
./scripts/agent-status.sh
```

## Recommended Next Agent Profile
- **Skills needed**: Vue.js, UI/UX design sense
- **Estimated time**: 4-6 hours to complete remaining 30%
- **Priority tasks**: Participant management UI, then error handling

## Questions for Next Agent to Consider
1. Should we add session replay functionality for completed sessions?
2. What export formats beyond JSON would be useful for researchers?
3. Should participant data withdrawal be reversible within a time window?

## Branch Status
- Branch name: `feature/agent-830-frontend-dashboard`
- Last commit: Various frontend components and test script
- PR status: Not created - wait until participant UI complete
- Conflicts: None with main or agent-950's branch
