# Agent Plan: agent-427-testing-and-validation

## Objective
Comprehensive testing and validation of Agent 799's AI conversation implementation

## Approach
Systematic testing of the AI simulation script with various configurations, documenting results, and creating automated tests

## Task Breakdown
- [x] Task 1: Initialize Agent 427 and set up testing environment
  - Estimated time: 30 minutes
  - Dependencies: None
- [ ] Task 2: Test with backend running and OpenAI API
  - Estimated time: 1 hour
  - Dependencies: Backend must be running
- [ ] Task 3: Test fallback behavior without OpenAI API
  - Estimated time: 30 minutes
  - Dependencies: None
- [ ] Task 4: Document all test results and edge cases
  - Estimated time: 45 minutes
  - Dependencies: Tests completed
- [ ] Task 5: Create automated test suite
  - Estimated time: 1 hour
  - Dependencies: Understanding of all test cases

## Success Criteria
- [ ] AI simulation runs successfully with OpenAI API
- [ ] Mock fallback works when API unavailable
- [ ] All edge cases documented
- [ ] Automated tests created and passing
- [ ] Test results report completed

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Backend not set up properly
  - **Mitigation**: Document setup requirements, work without backend if needed
- **Risk**: OpenAI API key not available
  - **Mitigation**: Test mock response fallback thoroughly

## Coordination Needs
- Need to coordinate with: agent-799 (they're completing documentation)
- Blocking: No one
- Blocked by: Nothing (Agent 799's implementation is complete)

## Next Steps
1. Complete test environment setup
2. Run comprehensive tests with various configurations
3. Document all findings and create test automation
