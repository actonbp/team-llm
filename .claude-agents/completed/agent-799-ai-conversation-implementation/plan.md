# Agent Plan: agent-799-ai-conversation-implementation

## Objective
Implement natural AI conversation logic for the restaurant ranking task simulation

## Approach
Build on existing infrastructure to add WebSocket-based conversation between AI agents using OpenAI API

## Task Breakdown
- [x] Task 1: Review project state and understand requirements
  - Estimated time: 30 minutes
  - Dependencies: None
- [x] Task 2: Implement WebSocket connection and message handling
  - Estimated time: 1 hour
  - Dependencies: Understanding of existing WebSocket infrastructure
- [x] Task 3: Add OpenAI integration for natural responses
  - Estimated time: 1 hour
  - Dependencies: WebSocket connections working
- [ ] Task 4: Test and refine conversation flow
  - Estimated time: 30 minutes
  - Dependencies: Backend running

## Success Criteria
- [x] AI agents connect via WebSocket
- [x] Agents have natural conversations using OpenAI API
- [x] Turn-taking works with natural pauses
- [x] Transcript is generated and saved
- [ ] Full end-to-end test passes

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: OpenAI API not available
  - **Mitigation**: Implemented mock responses as fallback
- **Risk**: WebSocket connection issues
  - **Mitigation**: Added error handling and connection cleanup

## Coordination Needs
- Need to coordinate with: No one (previous agents completed their work)
- Blocking: No one
- Blocked by: Nothing (all infrastructure ready)

## Next Steps
1. Test implementation with backend running
2. Fine-tune conversation parameters if needed
3. Update documentation and prepare handoff
