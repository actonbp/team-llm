# Handoff Notes: agent-799-ai-conversation-implementation ‚Üí Next Agent

**Handoff Date**: 2025-07-25 00:45:00
**From Agent**: agent-799-ai-conversation-implementation
**Work Completed**: Natural AI conversation implementation for restaurant ranking task

## What Was Done
- ‚úÖ Implemented AI conversation logic
  - Details: Created AIAgent class with WebSocket and OpenAI integration
  - Location: scripts/run_ai_simulation.py (lines 125-206)
- ‚úÖ Added natural turn-taking system
  - Details: 2-4 second pauses, prevents rapid responses
  - Location: scripts/run_ai_simulation.py (lines 283-308)
- ‚úÖ Integrated conversation context tracking
  - Details: Last 10 messages used for coherent responses
  - Location: scripts/run_ai_simulation.py (lines 184-189)
- ‚úÖ Created transcript generation
  - Details: Saves timestamped conversation to file
  - Location: scripts/run_ai_simulation.py (lines 319-325)

## What Remains
- üî≤ End-to-end testing with backend running
  - Why not completed: Focused on implementation first
  - Recommended approach: Run full test and tune parameters
- üî≤ Frontend integration
  - Blocker: Core conversation needed to be working first
  - Next steps: Connect SessionMonitor.vue to display live AI chat
- üî≤ Enhanced consensus detection
  - Current: Simple keyword matching
  - Improvement: Use AI to detect true agreement

## Important Decisions Made
1. **Decision**: Use AIAgent class for encapsulation
   - **Rationale**: Clean separation of concerns, easier testing
   - **Alternatives considered**: Functional approach, but OOP cleaner

2. **Decision**: 10-message context window
   - **Rationale**: Balance between coherence and API costs
   - **Impact**: Good continuity without excessive tokens

3. **Decision**: Mock response fallback
   - **Rationale**: Allow testing without OpenAI API key
   - **Impact**: System works for everyone, not just those with keys

## Gotchas & Warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WebSocket message format must be exact
  - Details: {"type": "chat", "content": "message"}
  - How to handle: Use the send_message method, don't craft manually
- ‚ö†Ô∏è OpenAI library may not be installed
  - Details: Script handles this gracefully with try/except
  - How to handle: pip install openai (optional)

## Test Results
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Full integration test: Not run yet (needs backend)
- ‚úÖ Code structure: Clean, no syntax errors
- ‚úÖ Mock responses: Working fallback

## Useful Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install websockets openai

# Run the backend
cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Run AI simulation
cd scripts && python run_ai_simulation.py

# Check generated transcript
ls scripts/transcript_*.txt
```

## Recommended Next Agent Profile
- **Skills needed**: Frontend (Vue.js) or Testing expertise
- **Estimated time**: 2-3 hours for frontend integration
- **Priority tasks**: 
  1. Run full test with backend
  2. Connect to SessionMonitor.vue
  3. Add conversation analytics

## Questions for Next Agent to Consider
1. Should we add conversation analytics (speaking time, turn counts)?
2. How to handle mixed human-AI teams?
3. Should consensus detection be more sophisticated?

## Branch Status
- Branch name: `feature/agent-799-ai-conversation-implementation`
- Last commit: `b8bb991` - docs: Update README - AI conversation implemented
- PR status: Not created yet
- Conflicts: None expected
